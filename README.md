Space and their stories always have been a mystery and fascinating. 
In a fantasy world with the space concept, we have created a 2D game adding our own twist and inspirations. A remake of the classic game "Space Impact" using C++ and Igraphics.h library.   In our game-EVER SPACE, a plane representing the main character is on a mission to battle with random enemies. In the game Our player’s goal is to destroy the enemies by firing bullets at them.
