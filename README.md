We, the team members not only tried to showcase our hard work but also our creativity through this project. Our main goal was to present and create a game to learn strategies while playing a game and at the same time, make it in a fun way. We tried to give our maximum effort and time into creating our very first project. So, we hope that everyone appreciates our hard work and likes our game. 
Space and their stories always have been a mystery and fascinating. In a fantasy world with the space concept, we have created a 2D game adding our own twist and inspirations. A remake of the classic game "Space Impact" using C++ and Igraphics.h library.   In our game-EVER SPACE, a plane representing the main character is on a mission to battle with random enemies. In the game Our player’s goal is to destroy the enemies by firing bullets at them.
